        This is a tool for negotiating relationships. Each of you will pick and choose what you want
        out of your relationship from a menu of options, and once you're both done, you can compare
        answers to see if you're on the same page or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tool isn't just for romantic relationships! Use it with your friends, platonic
        partners, play partners, or anyone else you want to build a healthier relationship with.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll often see this exercise referred to as the "relationship smorgasbord," referring to
        the way you can pick and choose what you want from a buffet of options. The concept is often
        associated with relationship anarchy.
