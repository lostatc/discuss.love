      This is a tool for negotiating relationships. Each of you pick and choose what you want out of
      your relationship from a menu of options, and once you're both done, you can compare answers
      to see if you're on the same page or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this tool is to start a discussion, not to replace one! Once you compare
      answers, take the time to ask each other clarifying questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll only see the answers that you agree on. If one of you selects "No" to a particular
      question, you won't see how the other person responded. Don't be afraid to say "Yes" to
      something just because you're worried the other person will say "No"!
    </p>
    <p>
      This tool isn't just for romantic relationships! Use it with your friends, your platonic
      partners, your play partners, or anyone else you want to build a healthier relationship with.
